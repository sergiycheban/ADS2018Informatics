# This algorithm is for sorting elements from array

- At row 10~15 we have array with 9 elements. Then we are walking around the array.
- At row 17 and 18 is written for a new line.
- –êt row 19 is temporary variable.
- At row 20~31 is two put "for" loops, and one "if" who check if parent is less from child then we want temporary variable equal to parent "for", parent "for" equal to child "for", child "for" equal to temporary variable.
- At row 33~37 we print the parent "for", and we see already sorted elements from array.
