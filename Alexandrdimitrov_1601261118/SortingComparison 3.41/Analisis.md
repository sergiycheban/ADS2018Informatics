# Title: Sorting Comparison
## Languege used: **C#**
## IDE: Visual studio 2015/2017

## Test 1 
### 10 elements:
10 elements is not much to go by so the results are very close but from 10 tests it is vissible that the **bubble sort** is fastest with an average of **.0000005** seconds followed by the **Selection sort** with a close average of **.0000007** and at last place came the **Insertion sort** with **.0000023**.

## Test 2
### 20 elements:
Not much different in terms of time from the first test we have the fastest **Bubble sort** followed by **Selection sort** and in last place **Insertion sort**.

## Test 3
### 50 elements:
With 50 elements things start to change the first place this time goes to **Insertion sort** with **.0000055** followed by **bubble sort** with **.0000090** and lastly **selection sort** with **.0000130**.

## Test 4
### 100 elements:
With 100 elements **Insertion sort** is fastest with **.0000126** followed by **bubble sort** with **.0000300** and in last place **Selection sort** **.0000326**.

## Test 5
### 1000 elements:
Pattern is the same **Insertion sort** with **.0016454** then **bubble sort** with **.0039565** then **Selection sort** with **.0046798**

## Test 6 
### 10000 elements:
**Insertion sort** with **.0974695** followed by **bubble sort** with **.4091873** and finally **Selection sort** with **.4097827**.

## Conclusion
From the tests we can see that in most cases Insertion sort is the most efficient and fastest sorting algorithm and it is way faster than the other two. From the other two bubble sort seems to be faster but the results are inconcluseve in my oppinion because the differences between bubble sort and selection sort were at times very slim and it all depended on the complexity of the array (given the fact that the arrays were filled with completely random numbers) so i would say that bubble sort and selection sort are tied in the end.
